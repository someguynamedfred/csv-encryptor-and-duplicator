# CSV Encryptor and Duplicator

Creates an encrypted duplicate of a selected CSV file. By default, it is looking for a CSV file called "tobeobliterated copy.csv" but you can change that in the code.

Use at your own risk. Back up your data and do not encrypt other people's stuff without their permission. 

To unencrypt, aim the code at the encrypted file and swap str1 and str2.
